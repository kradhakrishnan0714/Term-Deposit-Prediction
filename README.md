# Applied Statistics: Project 2 Inspiration  :clapper:
Shanara will add more details about the current state of the economy as the rationale for the banking & financial industries serving as the primary source of inspiration for our groupâ€™s data science project. This was a major influence on our team's interest in comparatively investigating the predictive proweress of various statistical models such as logistic regression, LDA & AMP and Random Forest. The plan for our predictive model is to provide financial professionals with insights in determining whether potential customers from various socio-economic backgrounds subscribe to banking term deposits through telemarketing campaigns.

# Project 2 Overview Term-Deposit-Prediction :bank: :heavy_dollar_sign: :telephone:
We Collaborated as a group to implement all the major components and competencies of Data Science. On the data engineering side, we began by choosing a topic that would add depth to our understanding of developing machine learning models in industries that were novel to us and outside of our domain expertise. We decided on banking and financial since this industry is a hot topic in today's economic landscape across the board. Next, we reviewed [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and datasets provided by our professor, Dr. Jacob Turner,  that were open-source and robust in the data it provided. We settled upon the following dataset from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository, which matched the criteria needed to meet our project goals. [Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). Finally, we preprocessed and cleaned our datasets, queried the data, built several machine learning models, and created an engaging and informative talking slide deck presentation using Canva, which you can view by clicking the link that will be available soon.

# Analysis :bar_chart: :green_apple: :fountain_pen:
Data is everywhere. The amount of data points at our disposal for consideration and analysis is expansive, immeasurable, and uniquely complex. Technology has proven to be a powerful tool assisting bankers in determining the probability of acquiring specific financial products and services. The likelihood that one will require financial advice and products in their lifetime is inevitable. With this in mind, our group selected banking and finance as our topic of interest to explore how predictive analytics could be used to accurately determine the Success of Term Deposit Subscriptions in Telemarketing Campaigns. Data science heavily influences advancements and innovations, creating meaningful changes that can be based on reliable outcomes, improved company success as well as their customers' quality of life. As progress in machine learning algorithms continues to develop and new technologies emerge, we can use various algorithmic tools and models to ensure efficacy, validity, and exponential rates of improvements when needed. Predictive modeling working in tandem with personalized financial products has innumerable advantages, such as empowering.... Using tools like our Term Deposit Prediction modles could be a wise investment, offering quick and easy banking products to customers who lack the time, mobility, or resources to venture outside of their homes during banking hours. After all, financial success doesn't happen haphazardly--it's the outcome of making data-driven informed decisions.  

There's a old proverbial statement that says "Your Health is Your Wealth," but we beleive these two may have a causal connection where under similar circumstances,  "Your Wealth is also Your Health"
